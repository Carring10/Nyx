            Nyx lived in Tartarus with her daughter
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemera#:~:text=In%20Greek%20mythology%2C%20Hemera%20%2F%CB%88,(the%20goddess%20of%20night)."
              >Hemera</a
            >. During the day, Nyx would leave Tartarus (while Hemera was
            returning) and fly up out of the Underworld and bring
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erebus">Erebus</a> together
            making it night time. When Nyx came back to Tartarus, Hemera left
            and scattered Erebus thus, revealing Aether
            <em>(the personification of the "upper sky")</em> and making it day.
            Later Eos the goddess of dawn came along and gave them a break.
            After that when Hemera arrived, Eos would leave then Nyx would
            leave.

            Nyx was a very powerful Protogenoi Deity, so much as to incur fear
            in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus">Zeus</a> himself as he
            didn't want to make her angry.

        <h3>Myth</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            Her main myth is still minor.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera">Hera</a> asked
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnos">Hypnos</a> to put
            Zeus to sleep so Hera could work behind his back. When Zeus found
            out he was outraged he chased Hypnos around the world with thunder.
            He would have driven Hypnos into the sea if he hadn't ran to Nyx.
            She made Zeus say he was sorry and stop chasing her son.
